# Event Planner

This project is an Event Planner application built using React and Vite.
# Event Planner React Project

This project is part of the *Developing Front End Apps with React* course

## How This Project Works

The **Event Planner** project is a React-based landing page application designed to help me practice building functional components and structuring a React app.

### Key Components

- **EventPlanner.jsx**: The main functional React component that serves as the landing page. It uses JSX to define the UI structure, including headers, descriptions, and other sections.
- **Footer.jsx**: A reusable footer component that is imported and included within the EventPlanner component to demonstrate component composition.
- **EventPlanner.css**: The CSS file that styles the components, keeping the UI visually organized and appealing.

### Development Environment

- The project is developed entirely within the **Cloud IDE**, a browser-based coding environment.
- You use the Cloud IDE terminal to run commands like `npm install` to install dependencies and `npm run preview` to start the development server.
- The Cloud IDE provides a live preview URL where you can see your React app running as you develop it.

### Workflow

1. **Code Writing**: Write React components using JSX syntax inside the Cloud IDE editor.
2. **Styling**: Apply styles using CSS files imported into your components.
3. **Running the App**: Use the terminal command `npm run preview` to launch the app and view it in the preview pane or a new browser tab.
4. **Version Control**: Manage your code with Git commands (`git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`) directly in the Cloud IDE terminal to track changes and push your code to GitHub.
5. **Component Composition**: Learn how to build modular, reusable UI parts by importing and including components like the Footer inside the main EventPlanner component.

### Benefits of Using Cloud IDE

- No local setup required — all development happens in the browser.
- Instant access to terminal and file explorer.
- Easy Git integration for source control.
- Live preview of your React application as you build it.

# What I Have Learned

 **Event Planner** project as part of the *Developing Front End Apps with React* course 

- **Building React Functional Components:** I learned how to create and structure React components using JSX syntax to build interactive user interfaces.

- **Component Composition:** I practiced composing reusable components, such as including the `Footer` component inside the main `EventPlanner` component, promoting modularity and code reuse.

- **Styling with CSS:** I applied modular CSS styles to your React components, enhancing the visual presentation and maintainability of MY application.

- **Project Organization:** I  organized My project files and folders effectively , understanding best practices for scalable React app structure.


- **Running React Development Server:** i used commands like `npm install` and `npm run preview`  to manage dependencies and launch the development server.


- **React Development Workflow:** I experienced the full development workflow from coding, styling, testing, to version control within a cloud-based environment.

This project has equipped me with a solid foundation to build scalable, maintainable React applications and prepared me for more advanced front-end development challenges.
